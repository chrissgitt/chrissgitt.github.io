        <p class="paragraph-section text-format-dark">
            Hi! I'm Christophe, I was born and grew up in Trinidad and Tobago, a small country
            in the Caribbean. From a young age, I developed a passion for technology and finance. The 
            synergy and dynamism which exists between these two industries has been a driving factor 
            for my intrinsic passion.
        </p><br>

        <p class="paragraph-section text-format-dark"> 
            In high school my education was centred around business and finance, I had a deep interest in 
            economics, with a particular affinity towards macro-economics. I developed an earnest interest 
            in analysing and quantifying human behaviour and the antecedent conditions which guided the 
            decisions made by individuals. I liked numbers however I discovered that numbers made the most 
            sense to me when put in the context of the real world, with something tangible.
        </p><br>

        <p class="paragraph-section text-format-dark">  
            At the University of the West Indies (STA), I began my bachelor’s degree, reading for a Banking and 
            Finance Major. It was here that I delved lightly into the branch of Mathematics known as statistics. 
            It was in my second year when I decided to pursue Computer Science as a minor and this was my first 
            introduction to computer programming, first learning this in C++. Very soon into learning how to code, 
            I realised I was not only quite good at it, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was at this juncture that 
            I decided to switch majors and pursue my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Whilst reading for 
            Computer Science I continued to take interest in numbers, data and making sense of all of it. I opted 
            to pursue electives which were heavily geared towards Mathematics, more specifically statistics.
        </p><br>

        <p class="paragraph-section text-format-dark"> 
            It was in the summer semester after officially switching my Major that I landed my first tech 
            internship. This opportunity was a demonstrable result of my passion for both finance and technology.
            I interned at one of Trinidad & Tobago’s large banks, First Citizens Bank, within their Group 
            Internal Audit Division. The experience entailed software development and performing data analytics 
            to process financial data, I could not be more apt for the role. It further instilled my fervour for 
            technology and finance and the ways in which the two industries intersect and rely upon each other.
        </p><br>

        <p class="paragraph-section text-format-dark">Growing up in the Caribbean has shaped my perspective on the role of finance and the pervasive 
            influence of technology globally. It has broadened my world view, with the idealistic goal of 
            making technology and financial products accessible to all, particularly in underserved and 
            underbanked regions. I see myself as an arbiter for this vision, a future where banking and 
            technology is democratised and accessible to all.
